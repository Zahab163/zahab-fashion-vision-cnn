# TensorFlow CNN Experiments

This folder contains experiments with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** using TensorFlow and Keras. Each notebook demonstrates different architectures, datasets, or training techniques for image classification and vision tasks.

## 📂 Contents
- `cnn.ipynb` – Basic CNN on CIFAR-10 dataset
- `data augmentation.ipynb` – Demonstrates techniques to expand training data (flips, rotations, shifts, etc.) for better CNN generalization.
- More experiments will be added here (e.g., data augmentation, transfer learning, object detection)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib
   ```
2. Open notebooks in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Run cells step by step to reproduce results.

## 🎯 Goal
To build a collection of reproducible CNN experiments for learning, teaching, and portfolio development.
